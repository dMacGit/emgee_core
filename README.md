This is the backend logic running my main project, the [Media Grabber Application](https://github.com/dMacGit/Media_Grabber).

### Background:

Want a automated way to backup your media collection to your computer? Well I do. 

Being inspired by a few other github projects on the web, I decided to create what I wanted based on my needs.

### Checklist

By the end of the project, I hope to have the followoing features.

* Scanning of CD's, DVD's and Blu Rays on insert for meta data.
* Parsing media meta data.
* Compatibility with, and interfacing to multiple connected optical media devices at once.
* Using 3rd party application/projects to automate backingup media.
* Offloading to 3rd party applications/projects for further processing.
* Keeping logs based on device/disc/backup job etc.
* Compatibity with Front end [Media Grabber Application](https://github.com/dMacGit/Media_Grabber).
